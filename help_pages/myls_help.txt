myls: This command lists information about all the files in the given directory.

Usage: myls [OPTIONS]... [DIRECTORY]

By Default,
    - The directory is set to current directory.
    - Results are sorted alphabetically.

Options:
    -l      more detailed listing format
    -a      entries starting with . are not ignored
    -S      sort results by file size, largest first
    -t      sort results by time, lowest first
    -r      reverses the order of sorting

NOTE:
    1) All the options can be used in succession in any order. E.g -> -la, -rS, -ltr, etc.
    2) -r when used with any other option, reverses the default sorting order of that option.
    3) When more than one sorting-based options are passed, the last option overrides the preceding options.
