mygrep: This command searches for patterns in a given file.

Usage: mygrep [OPTIONS]... PATTERNS [FILE]...

Options:
    -i      ignores case (e.g. matches "AbC" with "aBC")
    -w      matches only whole words
    -x      matches only whole lines
    -n      prints line number with output lines
    -c      prints only the count of lines in which matches are found

NOTE:
    1) All the options can be used in succession in any order. E.g -> -ni, -win, -ci, etc.
    2) A '.' in the input pattern can match with any character.
    3) In -w option, a word is considered a whole word only if the preceding and succeeding 
       characters are not alphanumeric.
    4) If -c is used in combination with any other option, only the count of those lines 
       is displayed which satisfy the constraints imposed by the other options.
